## What it does

The `publika` module shows public transport timetables from Finland's cities

## Functionalities

- Can display several stops and/or stations based on configuration
- Displays stop code, platform/track and ticket zones
- Supports english, finnish and swedish
- Supports multiple cities: Helsinki, Tampere, Turku among others. Check below to see [the full list](#supported-feeds)
- Supports VR schedules for long distance trains
- Displays times in realtime when available
- Displays cancelled trips
- Amount of stops to display can be configured for all stops or individually
- Displays disruptions (alerts) for services and stops/stations using different icons depending on severity
- Blinks when service departure time is less than one minute
- Can display route planning (currently only for VR train schedules)
- Can also display city bike stations
- Can display one stop or the whole station
  - For example, one train station has at least two stops, aka tracks. Some bus stations has several platforms
- Can set a delay start to a stop
  - For example in the case the stop is a bit far, so services that start before the delay are not shown
- Can set rules to show or hide stops
  - For example show only on weekdays between 15:00 and 16:00
- Stop and station IDs can be searched directly with the module
- Can be loaded multiple times in different positions or in the same

## Dependencies

- An installation of [MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>](http://magicmirror.builders/)
- DigiTransit (**required**, free): [https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/)
  - Used for fetching timetables and searching for stops and stations
  - Note: For now no API key is needed, but this would change in the future (april 2023)

| stopTimesCount | no | `number` | `5` | Amount of stops for all stops | `3` |

`stops` can be an array of string, number, `StopObject` or a mix of them:
```js
{
  config: {
    feed: "HSL",
    stops: [
      { id: "Tove Jansson", search: "stop" },
      1020453,
      { id: 1000105, type: "station" },
